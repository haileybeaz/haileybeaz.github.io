            <h1>Peer Review</h1>
            <p>James Worthen did a peer review of my wireframes and said that had great design aspects to them. He suggested to make sure I add more aspects to my web wireframe. Also, he suggested to think of way to make it easier to change the locaiton of your weather. I just have it as a tab. I think I will add that later into my desing and I did on my wireframe for my webpage I added more info on that page compared to my mobile sites. </p>
