    <h1>Advanced Typography</h1> <img src="images/typography.png" alt="basic typography">
    <p>Typography can be complex and very detailed. For this Presentation we are going to focus on the basics of typography for websites. We are not going to worry about actually creating fonts. </p>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h1>Basic Typography</h1> <img src="images/classification.png" alt="different types of type">
    <p>There are four different classifications of type. They are determine by their style of the individual letters. We are going to learn how they differ from each other and how they work together.</p>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h1>Serif Font</h1>
    <img src="images/serif.png" alt="serif fonts">
    <p>This is the classic "Times New Roman" the comes out with a little flair at the ends, but very minimal. It has an older look to it rather than modern. This is a great font for either headers or body content.  </p>  <div class="line"></div>
    <h1>Sans Serif Font</h1><img src="images/sans-serif.png" alt="san serif fonts">
    <p>Sans serif is just like serif except with out the flair completly. It has blunt ends and has a very modern look. This is a great font for both headers or body content. I personally like this one the most because it has a clean look. </p>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h1>Script Font</h1>
    <img src="images/script.png" alt="script fonts">
    <p>This font looks very similar to fancy handwriting. It can give a interesting personal look with these fonts. These fonts are really only good for headers because it can be difficult to read if it too small and use in body content. </p>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h1>Serif Font</h1>
    <img src="images/decorative.png" alt="decorative fonts">
    <p>Decorative is just like script. Every letter has it's own decoration that can be subtle or wild. It can add personality to your website. This is another font style to only use for headers not body content.</p>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <h1>Creating Contrast with Fonts</h1>
    <img src="images/contrast.png" alt="ways to contrast in typography">
    <p>You can create contrast with type in differents ways.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Different size font next to each other. Size of header compare to body font. </li>
    <li>
        Putting different font styles together. For example, Sans Serif agains Serif creates great contrast. </li>
        <li>Adding bold or italics can create contrast in your font. </li></ul>
    <p>Here are a few examples of good contrast in a website.
