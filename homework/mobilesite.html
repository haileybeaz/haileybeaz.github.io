                    <h2> Target Audience</h2>
                    <h3>What are the Demographics?</h3>
                    <ul>

                    <h3>How did the site meet the needs of the visitor?</h3>
                    <p>It gives information on travel sites in the United States. It gives a link to a free travel guide. Any person that wishes to visit the United States will want to know the best places to go.</p>
                    <h3>Describe how the content was organized to facilitate it being found.</h3>
                    <p>It has a search bar at th top if a person visiting the site wants to learn more about a specific spot in the united states. Then it is organized by destinations, trips, and experiences. This shows the prioties of the purpose of the site. They want the viewer to learn about the places they can go and then they can plan their trip to those places on the same site.</p>
                    <h3>What did the site to make the mobile experience enjoyable?</h3>
                    <p>I loved the simplicity and how it directed me to exactly what the viewer would want. The navigation wasn't too difficult and I could move myself around the site pretty well.</p>
                    <h3>Did the site seem to facilitate people in a mobile environment?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, I didn't have any issues with getting lost in th site. It minimized its information to what was important for the viewer.</p>

                    <h2> Site Contrast </h2>
                    <h3>What was the worst site you came across during the 24 hour mobile browsing experience?</h3>
                    <h1>Great Britain</h1>
                    <p>URL:<a href="http://www.visitbritain.com"> www.visitbritain.com</a> </p>
                    <h3>How did your best site differ from the worst in knowing who their target audience was?</h3>
                    <p>The better site was more clear that their target audiences was for young adults between 25-45. The feel of the site was modern. Where as the other site wasn;t as clear, though I believe their site was for the same age group. </p>
                    <h3>How did your best site differ from the worst in meeting the needs of their audience?</h3>
                    <p> The better site gave me direct information about what places I should go see. Where as the other site did, but not as plain and simple. They also didn't have a clear area to plan a trip.</p>
                    <h3>How did your best site differ from the worst in organizing content to facilitate it being found?</h3>
                    <p>Both of these websites had about the same kind of information, but they put them in a different order. The bette site had what most viewers wanted to see in the beginning of the page. The not so good one you had to scroll down a bit.</p>
                    <h3>How did your best site differ from the worst in facilitating visitors in a mobile environment?</h3>
                    <p>The better site looked like it was made for mobile views where as the other did not. The worst site looked more like a desktop than a mobile site. Its desktop version is much better to navigate. The items in the site didn't flow a well together in the mobile site. </p>

                    <h2>Persona</h2>
                    <!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the persona reading to build a persona for this site-->
                    <p>My persona is a 25 year old woman, Jane, from Toronto, Canada. She is in a relationship, but no married. She works for a major business company as foreign management. She works with other branches of their company located in several places around the world. She makes presentations to represent the company to make sure everyone is on the same page for goals.  For her work she is tech savy. She is busy and always on a time crunch so she needs thing to be clear and fast. She believes in getting the job done well and quick. She is always traveling and when she can she tries to see the top spots of where she visit. She has a laptop, but it is her mobile device that she has on her at all times. She usually does not spend much time broswing for long her phone. She likes to do things quick.</p>
