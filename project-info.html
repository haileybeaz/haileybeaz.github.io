<h1>Project Purpose</h1>
    <p>To give information what is available to do in or near Rexburg, Idaho area.
    </p>
    <h1>The Audience</h1>
    <p>My main audience are student. Both male and female from the ages 18-27. It can also range to anyone that is unfamiliar to the area of Rexburg. Since students are my audience it will influence what kind of info on my websites. Usually students are low on money so they want things to do that doesn’t cost too much money. They also want things that they can do on a date or in a group of friends. The activities need to be close to the area because most students don’t have great modes of transportation.
